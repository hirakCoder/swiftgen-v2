# Frontend Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **JavaScript Initialization Conflict**
   - Problem: Both app.js and index.html were trying to initialize their own classes
   - Solution: Disabled app.js initialization, using only SwiftGenApp from index.html
   - Files changed: app.js (lines 1166-1169 commented out), index.html (line 12-13 commented out app.js import)

2. **Variable Redeclaration Error**
   - Problem: 'input' variable was declared twice with const in app.js
   - Solution: Renamed second occurrence to 'errorInput' and 'errorSendBtn'
   - File changed: app.js (lines 661-664)

3. **Missing Favicon**
   - Problem: Browser was requesting favicon.ico causing 404 error
   - Solution: Added inline SVG favicon in HTML head
   - File changed: index.html (line 7)

## Current State:

The frontend should now load without JavaScript errors. The app uses the SwiftGenApp implementation embedded in index.html, which is the working version based on previous conversations.

## Note:

The app.js file contains a different implementation (SwiftGenChat) that expects a different HTML structure. It's currently disabled but could be used in the future if the HTML is updated to match its requirements.

## Remaining Warning:

The Tailwind CSS CDN warning is expected in development and can be ignored. For production, Tailwind should be installed as a PostCSS plugin as the warning suggests.
